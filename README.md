# Jamming Functional

The aim of this project is to rewrite the **Jamming** React project on Codecademy's React course using functions and hooks instead of classes. 

The project is written from scratch, not a refactor. It will likely have a different style and additional functionality from the original when completed.

Feel free to clone the code and learn about functional React components with me!
