# Jamming Functional

The aim of this project is to rewrite the **Jamming** React project on Codecademy's React course using functions and hooks instead of classes. 

The project is written from scratch, not a refactor. It has similar functionality to the original app made on the Codecademy course, but works fairly differently under the hood.
